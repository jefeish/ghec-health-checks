# Documentation Images

## Image handling

- We use [Drawio](https://www.drawio.com) as our Diagram editing tool, since it has a VS-Code extension for editing images in the IDE.
- To embed the created images in a markdown file, save the [Drawio](https://www.drawio.com) image as a SVG file and reference the file, eg.: `![diagram](docs/images/foo.svg)`.
- Please use `SVG` files (not PNG), since they are plain text and `git` can source controll them.

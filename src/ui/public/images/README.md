# Description

This folder is a placeholder for documentation images used in the UI React documentation component.

We source our documentation content from the root folder, `docs/`, images used in that Markdown can be found within the `docs/images` subfolder.

To incorporate these images from the README.md file into the UI React documentation component, we must duplicate them into the `src/ui/public/images/` directory (this folder).
